# BottahðŸŽ¤ðŸ’Œ
*Why stress typing emails when you can just speak??*  With just your voice, you can now send emails faster than you can type. <br/>
Simply dictate the recipient, subject, and body of the me
ssage, and Bottah will handle the rest.

## How it works?
1. Just say the name of the person you want to email.
2. Tell Bottah the subject of your email.
3. Speak your heart out. 
4. Once all the info is in, Bottah sends the email via your gmail account. Like magik :o
